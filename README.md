I chose a hybrid portfolio to showcase some personal projects I've worked on along with the professional tasks I have and hope to cwork on in the future.<br>
I chose to add an image of myself because it adds a personal feel to the site which makes people feel more familiar with the content and work.<br>

# CSS Assignment 
## CSS : <br>
* Overall design : <br>
  I chose a minimalistic , modern design because it portrays my design style. <br>
  It gives a clean and organised feeling which is how I like my projects to be.<br>
* Typography : <br>
  The fonts are both sans-serif for easy readability and it contributes to the clean aesthetic.<br>
* Colours : <br>
  All the colours I used are calming while still creating a large enough contrast for accessibility. <br>
  (Final colours have not been decided yet)
* Layout : 
  The navigation bar was centered and changed into a horizontal list to make it easily locatable. <br>
  
## Advanced CSS : <br>  
* Challenges / Ideas : <br>
  Nearly every part of this section challenged me :(. <br>
  I found it difficult to optimise the structure for mobile-first and it took me quite a few tries to do. <br>
* Decisions - Naviagtion , Structure : <br>
  With the minimalistic effect in mind I kept a lot of white space. <br>
  The buttons that change colour add a fine touch of interactivity. <br>
  Toggled navigation is easier to use on smaller screens so I added it for efficiency. <br>
* Mobile-first / Responsiveness : <br>
  The trasition times are fast on elements. <br>
  I used fast-loading media and clean code to help the site load efficiently on mobile. <br>
  Transitions add to the feel of the sight. <br>
